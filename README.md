# Project_week4
This project transforms raw flight records into a structured SQL database to uncover key insights. 
The dataset used was a CSV file from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/traveler-trip-data.
Containing flight records with details such as destinations, travelers, accommodation, transportation.
Starting from unorganized datasets, we designed and implemented a relational schema that organizes flight information efficiently.
Through data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, we reveal patterns and trends that turn data into meaningful information.
